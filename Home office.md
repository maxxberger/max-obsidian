[[Return to office (RTO)]] is a strategy of companies to call their employees back to the office on full time basis and return to the world before COVID-19 pandemic.

According to KPMG, 66% of 1325 managers, out of which 125 from Germany, believe their employees would return to the office full-time in the next 3 years. In Germany, 68% believe that.

University of Konstanz found that only 9% of employees would like to work full time in the office, 73% would like to work in a hybrid mode, and ca. 1/5 would like to work fully remotely.

According to research, individual [[happiness]] increases in HO, however, identification with the company decreases. On the other hand, forcing people is not a good [[motivation]] tool. 

# Groups opposing remote work
Only three kinds of people oppose remote work:
1) Middle managers who need to justify their existence and crave petty power.
2) People who hate their home life and/or lack any semblance of friends without office culture.
3) Landlords and bankers with office real estate.

4-year study of [[S&P500]]: when firms required people to come in, profits failed to climb - while job satisfaction & [[work-life balance]] fell. When you want people onsite, don't treat them like toddlers. Make the trip worth their time. - [[Adam Grant]]
